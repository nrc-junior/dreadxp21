  - Hi, you should be the Enginner.
  - "That\u2019s right, also the only one who give a ship about the conditions of
    this ship."
  - So I kind of own you, you make this ass holes, make upgrades in the ship, so
    thanks.
  - What your tongue Demeter.
  - Yah yah, Sir
  - The captain said you wanted to talk to me
  - 'That is right '
  - So what do you want?
  - So if you want to use the submarine you should now first about to radio signal.
  - That keeps all your base functions working without a manual control.
  - So you can operate them alone, or keep focused on you research instead of knowing
    how to control the submarine.
  - and keep aware of the propellers ...
  - you really think we understand a world you've just said?
  - "aaaaahhh stupid\u2019s"
  - yeh yeh, we are brain damaged, now can we do a test drive, you will learn a lot
    better testing.
  - So get to the sub, and try to get the ships Key
  - this is a toy key
  - So what?, get the fucking keys
