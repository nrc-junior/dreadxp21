  - What happened now ?
  - Look, the engines stopped last night.
  - So?
  - So.. It means we can't move
  - Can we fix it?
  - "I think so\u2026 But Demeter ask me to tell you"
  - 'If you really want to go to the next dive point, and we are really close, he
    can make some upgrades for you, to make the dive alone. '
  - The ship will wait for you here.
  - Yeah, sure, how?
  - I highly recommend you to not do that, things are really bad the way they are,
    I suggest we take this time to fix the ship, and get the hell out of this place
